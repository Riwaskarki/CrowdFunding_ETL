# Group_project_10
The Repo has the work from the group 10 on ETL project.
The Project has 3 parts. First the extraction, second transformation and final part Load.
The work was divided equally for all the team members.
The extraction and transformation was done by Riwas and Mark and the SQl part was done by Nepat.
For the data transformation we have used the pandas. We also used regex for the transformation but 
we have not include that part in repo. The regex part can be provided upon request.
For the Sql part we used the postgres sql for designing the schema.
##Conclusion
To conclude despite of the time constrains the project went really well and we were able come up with best
work we could do as a team.
